      <p class="why-swim">Swimming is one of the best, most complete forms of exercise for your dog. Just one minute of
        swimming equates to four minutes of running! It provides numerous health benefits, including strengthening the
        heart and lungs, decreasing inflammation, increasing metabolism, and improving circulation which helps keep the
        skin and coat healthy. Plus, moving their limbs against the resistance of the water uses every major muscle
        group, improving overall tone and strength.</p>
