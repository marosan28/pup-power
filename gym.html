    <p class="text-gym1">Exercising keeps your dog healthy and limber while reducing behavioural problems such as
      excessive licking, barking, chewing, digging, and other anxiety-related behaviours. It also helps your dog build
      trust and confidence in you and in their environment</p>
    <p class="text-gym2">The recommended amount of daily exercise for most dogs is 30 minutes to 2 hours, although
      certain dogs need more. Some breeds were developed for more active lifestyles than others, and in a companion dog
      situation, they are not able to do the work their ancestors were bred to do</p>
    <p class="text-gym3">Some countries have tried to make dog excercising a matter of law. In 2020, a law was
      introduced in Germany that mandated the country’s dog owners walk their dogs twice a day for at least an hour
      total. As the minister responsible for the bill noted, “Dogs are not cuddly toys. They also have their own needs,
      which need to be taken into account.”</p>
    <p class="text-gym4">For active, healthy dogs, a variety of exercise is important, says Dr. Darryl Millis, DVM,
      Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons and the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine
      and Rehabilitation, and a Certified Canine Rehabilitation Practitioner. “Dogs are aerobic animals and are built
      for jogging and running distances, with periodic rest. So leash walking alone will not result in peak
      conditioning.”</p>
