            The colours chosen are soft, opal #90bec0 is calming for the eyes while lilac #a790a5 is considered a happy color, beige #f5f5dc is a soft colour that makes a perfect background in this case.
            The colour palette was generated by [Coolors website](https://coolors.co/)

    -   #### Typography
        -   The *Hubballi* font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback. *Hubballi* is used because of the roundness of letters. Round shapes give the content softness, which makes a website appeal friendly and inviting.
        The *Playfair Display SC* font is used for all the headings throught the website, as it's fancy and more elegant, it's job is to bring the attention to the content. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The main images used are illustrations of dogs holding white boxes which were used as text boxes. The illustrations are giving the site uniqueness. They are more visually appealing and they add humor which makes the website appear fun.
        -   The landscape images are used because of their brightness and colours present in the images. As their bright colours provide a contrast to the soft page they give the website a more lively look. 
        -   The portrait images were used because of the clear background which makes them appear clean and blend in with the layout.
