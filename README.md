            The colour palette was generated by [Coolors website](https://coolors.co/)

    -   #### Typography
        -   The *Hubballi* font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback. *Hubballi* is used because of the roundness of letters. Round shapes give the content softness, which makes a website appeal friendly and inviting.
        The *Playfair Display SC* font is used for all the headings throught the website, as it's fancy and more elegant, it's job is to bring the attention to the content. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The main images used are illustrations of dogs holding white boxes which were used as text boxes. The illustrations are giving the site uniqueness. They are more visually appealing and they add humor which makes the website appear fun.
